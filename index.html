    <h1>Legal Versioning</h1>
    <p>Legal Versioning is a standardized, readable, and computable way to number versions of legal forms, notices, and policies.</p>
    <p>Legal Versioning gives drafters a simple, clear, and concise way to tell users how much has changed and what they should review as terms improve over time. Legal Versioning also enables computers to understand and compare version numbers, so they can help automate rote document management tasks.</p>

    <h2 id=summary>Quick Summary</h2>
    <p>Versions are written as numeric codes, as for computer software. The simplest have three numbers, like <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>2.0.0</code>, and so on.  The most complex have four:</p>
    <figure>
    <pre>
                3.4.1-2
                │ │ │ │
third edition ──┘ │ │ └── second draft
                  │ │     (optional)
                  │ │
fourth update ────┘ └──── first correction</pre>
    </figure>
    <p>So <code>3.4.1-2</code> denotes the second draft of the second correction to the fourth update or the third edition.</p>
    <p>Changes to the four numbers send different messages to users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Increasing the <em>edition</em> number tells users of lower-numbered editions to review the new version top-to-bottom to decide whether it meets their needs.</p></li>
      <li><p>Increasing the <em>update</em> number tells users of lower-numbered updates to review the parts that have changed to decide whether it meets their needs.</p></li>
      <li><p>Increasing the <em>correction</em> numbers tells users that they should always use the newly corrected version.</p></li>
      <li><p><em>Draft</em> numbers tell users that particular copies are working drafts, not final versions ready for use.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id=editions>Editions</h2>
    <p>The first number is the edition number. Publishing a version like <code>9.0.0</code> followed by a higher-numbered version like <code>10.0.0</code> sends a specific message to users.  Users of <code>9.0.0</code> should review the entire text of new <code>10.0.0</code> to decide if the new edition meets their needs, as <code>9.0.0</code> did.</p>
    <aside class=example>
      <p>Jane publishes a form nondisclosure agreement as <code>1.0.0</code>.  Later on, Jane completely redrafts the form from scratch and publishes her new version as <code>2.0.0</code>.</p>
      <p>Bob used <code>1.0.0</code> with business clients for several months.  On seeing new <code>2.0.0</code>, he understands he should read <code>2.0.0</code> top to bottom to see if it will work with his business and clients.</p>
    </aside>
    <h2 id=updates>Updates</h2>
    <p>Drafters often update terms to add or remove material, leaving most language unchanged.  Versions like <code>1.1.0</code> or <code>10.0.15</code> describe these changes.</p>
    <p>Publishing a new version with a higher update number sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10.0.0</code> should compare new <code>10.1.0</code> to old <code>10.0.0</code>, and review what has changed, to see whether the changes serve their needs.  Users of a <code>10.7.0</code> should compare a new <code>10.0.10</code> and review what has changed.  But users of a <code>10.0.0</code> should review a new <code>11.1.0</code> top-to-bottom, since the drafter used a higher edition number.</p>
    <aside class=example>
      <p>Adam publishes a form product-returns policy as <code>7.0.0</code>.  Super Mart reviews <code>7.0.0</code> and begins using it in stores.</p>
      <p>Adam later changes <code>7.0.0</code> to replace language about cash refunds.  Since the rest of the policy remains the same, Adam publishes his newly revised policy as <code>7.1.0</code>.  Super Mart&rsquo;s team sees new <code>7.1.0</code>, compares it to <code>7.0.0</code>, which they’re already using, and reviews the new language on cash refunds.  Since Super Mart prefers the old language on cash refunds, so they stick with <code>7.0.0</code> in their stores.</p>
    </aside>
    <h2 id=corrections>Corrections</h2>
    <p>Some changes don’t add, remove, or change meaningful pieces of language, but merely correct spelling, structural, or other technical errors.  Versions like <code>3.0.1</code> or <code>7.11.3</code> describe these changes.</p>
    <p>Publishing a new correction to an old edition or update sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10.0.0</code> should use <code>10.0.1</code> instead, and can do so without reviewing the changes.  Of course, users may always <em>choose</em> to review the changes.  But correction numbers in the Legal Versioning system allow drafters to communicate when changes go to form, rather than substance.</p>
    <aside class=example>
      <p>Professor Miller publishes a privacy notice for medical patients as <code>3.3.0</code>.  Doctor Waller begins using <code>3.3.0</code> in his practice.</p>
      <p>Professor Miller later spots a spelling error.  She quickly corrects it, and publishes a new <code>3.3.1</code>.  As soon as Doctor Waller sees that a new <code>3.3.1</code> is available, he begins using it, wondering why he hadn’t spotted the typo himself.</p>
    </aside>
    <h2 id=drafts>Drafts</h2>
    <p>Drafters often create working drafts before publishing final versions.  Versions like <code>8.0.0-1</code> or <code>2.1.5-3</code> describe these drafts.</p>
    <p>Publishing a document with a draft number sends a specific message to users.  Users of a <code>10.3.0</code> should continue to use <code>10.3.0</code>, even when <code>10.3.1-1</code>, <code>10.3.0-4</code>, or <code>11.0.0-15</code> are available.  Drafters working together to create a <code>13.0.0</code> should review <code>13.0.0-7</code> instead of old <code>13.0.0-6</code>.</p>
    <aside class=example>
      <p>A community advocacy group is preparing a form community foundation charter.  The lead drafter prepares an initial draft, <code>1.0.0-1</code>.  After a round of comments, the group produces <code>1.0.0-2</code>.</p>
      <p>Bob wants to start a community foundation for his local neighborhood.  He sees the advocacy group’s <code>1.0.0-2</code> online.  Since he does not see a final <code>1.0.0</code> without a draft number, he contacts the advocacy group to ask about the status of the form project.</p>
